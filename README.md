Basically, this is a reddit/ruqqus style forum, but you can post to different communities at the same time. It runs on python 3. Flask, bcrypt, and sqlalchemy are required. Running it is simple, just set `PYTHONPATH` to the root repo directory and run `python3 forum/__main__.py`.

This is just a small project I made for fun and is **not supported in any way**. Security is not a consideration and this project is very unstable. As such, it is not recommended for real-world use.

To-do List:

* [ ] Add actual styling

* [ ] Add mod and admin tools

* [ ] Make html files more functional

* [ ] Clean up flask templates

* [ ] Improve db speed

* [ ] Add user settings, subscriptions, password/email changes, etc.

* [ ] Move to actual db instead of temp db

* [ ] Add working API outside of browser session
