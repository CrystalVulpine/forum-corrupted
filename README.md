Basically, this is a reddit/ruqqus style forum, but you can post to different communities at the same time. It runs on python 3. Flask, bcrypt, and sqlalchemy are required. Running it is simple, just use `python3 forum/__main__.py`.

This is just a small project I made for fun and is **not supported in any way**. Security is not a consideration and this project is very unstable. As such, it is not recommended for real-world use.
