This is a reddit/ruqqus style forum, but with the added perk that you can submit a post to multiple communities at once. It's just a small project I made for fun and is **not supported in any way**. Security is not a consideration and this project is very unstable. It is not recommended for real-world use, and I am not responsible for any issues it causes you.

## Setup

This app runs on python3. In addition, flask, flask-markdown, bcrypt, and sqlalchemy must be installed. Running it is simple, just set `PYTHONPATH` to the root repo directory and run `python3 forum/__main__.py`. You should then be able to access the home page from your web browser with http://127.0.0.1:5000.
